Leaking pipelines can lead to spillage of hydrocarbon fluid into the surrounding environment, and consequently result in fire or outright explosion of the pipeline system as well as production loss, damage to the environment and potential loss of lives. In this research, the relationship of pressure distribution and leak parameters is built through the simulation models. After running the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with commercial software (FLUENT), the pressure distribution in the pipeline with leakage in the CFD experiments will be verified by the published experimental data.

Quick detection will not only reduce the loss of transported oil and gas but also can protect the local environment. The modelling is for leakage taking place from variable flow inlet velocity under constant hole diameter. The results are to present a relationship between hole diameter and leakage flow pattern, and this will generally improve mechanical design, control systems and monitoring techniques which normally depend on pressure, flow rate and temperature. A correlation between the mass flow rate of the leakage and the various parameters of the pipeline system will be studied.

Three-dimension (3D) computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations under steady-state are carried out to examine the effects of blockage diameter, blockage length, and blockage location.
