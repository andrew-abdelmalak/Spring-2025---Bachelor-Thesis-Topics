In CLASH we mainly focus on a specific scene in coordinating autonomous systems which is the intersection management.

Moreover, we extend the project to experiment different intersection scenarios as our case-studies.

Proper modeling methods will be incorporated, including mathematical modeling and others. The model should be able to reflect both the longitudinal, lateral and vertical dynamics of the vehicle. The developed models would be validated against the existing hardware for the vehicle in the MRS lab. The model would be developed in a parameterized manner in order to be able to demonstrate different cases.",
      "The student will be expected to deliver a functioning set of models for the vehicle, along with the comparative study between them. Moreover, validation of the developed models against existing hardware as well as existing literature is needed. Parametric study would be conducted along with different scenarios testing to test the capabilities of the model. The performance metrics related to accuracy of the model would be considered."

Smart chargers constantly communicate with the battery throughout the whole process and they only supply charge depending on the battery’s exact needs. This prevents overor undercharging, which can reduce the battery’s lifespan.",

In this research, the relationship of pressure distribution and leak parameters is built through the simulation models. After running the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with commercial software (FLUENT), the pressure distribution in the pipeline with leakage in the CFD experiments will be verified by the published experimental data.

The modelling is for leakage taking place from variable flow inlet velocity under constant hole diameter. The results are to present a relationship between hole diameter and leakage flow pattern, and this will generally improve mechanical design, control systems and monitoring techniques which normally depend on pressure, flow rate and temperature. A correlation between the mass flow rate of the leakage and the various parameters of the pipeline system will be studied.
